   abstract = "PDifferences in features supported by the various contemporary commercial workflow management systems point to different insights of Isuitability/I and different levels of Iexpressive power/I. The challenge which we undertake in this paper is to systematically address workflow requirements from basic to complex. Many of the more complex requirements identified recur quite frequently in the analysis phases of workflow projects however their implementation is uncertain in current products. Requirements for workflow languages are indicated through workflow Ipatterns/I. In this context patterns address business requirements in an imperative workflow style expression but are removed from specific workflow languages. The paper describes a number of workflow patterns addressing what we believe identify comprehensive workflow functionality. These patterns provide the basis for an in-depth comparison of a number of commercially available workflow management systems. As such this paper can be seen as the academic response to evaluations made by prestigious consulting companies. Typically these evaluations hardly consider the workflow modeling language and routing capabilities and focus more on the purely technical and commercial aspects./P",

The challenge we address is to record uniform andusable provenance metadata that meets the domain needs while minimizingthe modification burden on the service authors and the performanceoverhead on the workflow engine and the services. The frameworkis based on generating discrete provenance activities during thelifecycle of a workflow execution that can be aggregated to formcomplex data and process provenance graphs that can span acrossworkflows. The implementation uses a loosely-coupled publish-subscribearchitecture for propagating these activities and the capabilitiesof the system satisfies the needs of detailed provenance collection.A performance evaluation of a prototype finds a minimal performanceoverhead in the range of 1 for an eight service workflow using271 data products.},

In this paper we create a taxonomy of dataprovenance techniques and apply the classification to current researchefforts in the field. The main aspect of our taxonomy categorizesprovenance systems based on why they record provenance what theydescribe how they represent and store provenance and ways to disseminateit.
